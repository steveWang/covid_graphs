Some scriptlets that I've thrown together for pulling latest updates from a
variety of data sources (Johns Hopkins, New York Times, COVID Tracking Project)
and graphing the data in a consistent fashion.

There are also a handful of experiments in place for comparing cases on a
partisan basis (by vote share, statewide as well as county-wide), and some quick
& dirty analyses for pool testing viability versus test positive rates (using
some usefully wrong assumptions about test results being iid in a locality).
